Renders a rotating cube, using OpenGL (GLSL 4.6).

## Description
This'll serve as a portfolio for my progression towards learning OpenGL. As of right now, it simply renders a rotating cube. Hopefully, when I have more time, I'll implement more features. I'll be exploring a bunch of graphical concepts and methods. The goal of this is to further my understanding of OpenGL and graphics rendering in general.
